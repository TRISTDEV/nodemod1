This is a binary release of h3270-1.3.3 for Windows.  It consists of a
vanilla Tomcat 5.0.28 with h3270 deployed into it as a web
application.  The directory s3270-bin contains a pre-built binary of
s3270 version 3.3.1-alpha10 that runs on Windows using the Cygwin
environment.  The Cygwin DLL is also included.  These are the only
operating system-specific files in this release.

To use this software, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or
Java Developer's Kit (JDK, j2sdk) version 1.4 or higher.  We will call
the directory where you unpacked this release $H3270_BIN.  First, go
to $H3270_BIN/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/webapps/h3270/WEB-INF and edit the
file h3270-config.xml.  In this file, change the <exec-path> entry so
that it contains the absolute path to $H3270_BIN/s3270-bin (that is,
the path to the s3270 binary that is part of this release).  Don't
include s3270 itself within that path, the directory is enough.

Once you've done that, go to H3270_BIN/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28 and type
bin/startup.sh.  Then point your web browser to
http://localhost:8080/h3270/servlet, and everything should be up and
running.

For documentation, please see the h3270 web site at
h3270.sourceforge.net, or download the full source code release which
includes documentation.
